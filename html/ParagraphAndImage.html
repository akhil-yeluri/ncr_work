<p>We'll also have a current node. Initially, we set it to C (our selected node). In the image, we mark the current node with a red dot.

Now, we check the neighbours of our current node (A, B and D) in no specific order. Let's begin with B. We add the minimum distance of the current node (in this case, 0) with the weight of the edge that connects our current node with B (in this case, 7), and we obtain 0 + 7 = 7. We compare that value with the minimum distance of B (infinity); the lowest value is the one that remains as the minimum distance of B (in this case, 7 is less than infinity):</p>
